# Future

This is an early version. But i wanted to share my code.
Not all domains are built in right now. So it may not fulfill all wishes and use cases.

Things i want to add:

- themes for menu bar at bottom (maybe just on mobile)
- add all entity domains
- add conditional cards for binary sensors to only show on state (like only showing open windows in room view and hiding them when they are closed)
- add support for more views/tabs to be responsive

Feel free to open an issue or a feature request [here](https://github.com/xBourner/auto-dash/issues)
