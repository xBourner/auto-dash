I tried to built a dashboard which is auto generated without the use of javascript.
The only thing which are needed are custom cards. Take a further look into config to see whats needed.

- responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- auto generated and sorted by areas and domains


Here is the latest screenshot of the progress.
